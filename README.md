# GitHub Line Length custom user stylesheet for Chrome

This Chrome extension adds a highlighted column at 80 characters
to pull-request pages on GitHub.

1. Clone repository
2. Go to chrome://extensions (Menu -> More Tools -> Extensions)
3. Check the "Developer mode" box in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." button; select the directory

The stylesheet can be edited to suit your preference. The width of the
`after` element *should* be equal to the column number you'd like to
highlight, but you might have to play around with it a bit.
